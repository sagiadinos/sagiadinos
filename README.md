# Niko Sagiadinos

Digital Signage is a market dominated by overpriced, vendor-locked black boxes.
I build the open alternative.

## What I'm Building

**[garlic-player](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-player)**: A SMIL-based media player 
for Linux, Android and macOS. No license fees, no cloud dependency, no bullshit.

**[garlic-hub](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-hub)**: The CMS behind it. 
Device management, content scheduling, playlist control.

**[garlic-launcher](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-launcher)**: Root-free Android 
launcher to keep players locked down and maintained in the field.

Together they form a complete, self-hosted digital signage stack — from content creation 
to playback. AGPL licensed.

## Who This Is For

- Integrators tired of paying per-device fees to SaaS platforms
- Companies that need on-premise solutions with full control over their data
- Developers who want to extend or embed a standards-compliant SMIL player
