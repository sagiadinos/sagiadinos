Digital Signage is a market dominated by overpriced, vendor-locked black boxes.
I build the open alternative.

## How it started
In 2011 I built a commercial digital signage CMS to manage hundreds of IAdea players for a client because there was no affordable, SMIL-compatible solution that fit the job. Over the years, resellers started building their own proprietary players instead of paying for certified hardware. Most failed. So in 2017 I built an open-source media player that anyone could use and contribute to. The launcher, proxy, and hub followed.

The goal: a complete, open digital signage ecosystem.

## What I'm Building

**[garlic-player](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-player)**: A SMIL-based media player 
for Linux, Android and macOS. No license fees, no cloud dependency, no bullshit.

**[garlic-hub](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-hub)**: The CMS behind it. 
Device management, content scheduling, playlist control.

**[garlic-launcher](https://github.com/garlic-signage/garlic-launcher)**: Root-free Android 
launcher to keep players locked down and maintained in the field.

Together they form a complete, self-hosted digital signage stack — from content creation 
to playback. AGPL licensed.
